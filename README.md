How different advertising content strategies in various videos influence viewers' attitudes is evaluated. This includes examining how advertising features in videos produced by influencers impact viewers' attitudes. The advertising features being considered include the proportion of advertising duration, placement of advertisements, and the alignment between video content and the advertised products. Additionally, the study looks into the heterogeneous effects of this influence on different influencers' impact.

In this project, we develop a **theoretical model** to examine how different advertising strategies in self-produced videos on self-media platforms influence viewers' attitudes. The study involves **crawling self-produced videos** with advertising content, using **image and text analysis** to extract video content features, and exploring the impact of these features on viewers' attitudes towards the video creators and the video itself. Based on the theoretical framework of consumer information processing, these features are categorized into those that initially attract viewers' attention and those that require in-depth information processing.
